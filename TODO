Things it might be nice to do someday.  I haven't evaluated all of
these suggestions... their presence here doesn't imply my endorsement.

* Parallelise class Species with MPI
  DONE 

* Improvment of the parallelism for class Species
  Give the user the possibility to choose the configuration of
  processes/species. Move all parallelism to the SpeciesHandler level.

* Add a test mode to check timing

* Dump and Reload facilities (checkpoint)

* Full electro magnetic code

* Fluid approach with momentum equations (currents)

* Better approach to Boltzmann fluid and quasi-neutrality
